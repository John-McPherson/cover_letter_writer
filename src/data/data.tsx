    "Thank you for considering me for the role of {{jobTitle}} at {{company}}. I am a web developer with 3 years of experience with JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and PHP. I am passionate about learning, and improve my skills and I am confident about my ability to quickly upskill to match any business needs. I thrive in roles that challenge me,  I donâ€™t want a role where I know how to do everything. I want to be constantly learning.",

    "I work well under pressure. As part of my role I create digital assets for medical congresses. There is a significant regulation surrounding medical advertising, and during one congress I had to rework an entire app due to a challenge from another exhibitor. We managed to get a new working version up before the congress opened to attendees and our client faced no significant down time.",
    "I am also interested in optimising my workflow. We create apps for a platform called Veeva which has a particular file structure, screenshots of each page,  and requires an upload manifest. I created a node.js script that took screenshots, created the correct file structure and built the upload manifest. That previously took 1-2 hours per deployment and reduced it to seconds and also reduced human error to a none factor. ",

    "Outside of my technical skills I am currently a member of the DE&I team at my work and have been involved in multiple events and indicatives throughout the year. And In my current role, I am often the first point of contact for non-technical colleagues despite the fact that I am one of the more junior developers. I believe this is due to my participation in work events, and my friendly demeaner.",
